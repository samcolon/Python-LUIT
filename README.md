EC2 Name Generator - Use Python to create unique EC2 names that users can attach to instances.

Foundational:
1. All the user to input how many EC2 instances they want names for and output the same amount of unique names.
2. Allow the user to input the name of their department that is used in the unique name.
3. Generate random characters and numbers that will be included in the unique name.

This code can be found in EC2_Random_Generator_Fundamentals.py

Advanced:
The only departments that should use this Name Generator are the Marketing, Accounting, and FinOps Departments. List these departments as options and if a user puts another department, print a message that they should not use this Name Generator.

This code can be found in EC2_Random_Generator_Advanced.py

Complex:
Turn the above into a Function and execute the Function to verify it works.
